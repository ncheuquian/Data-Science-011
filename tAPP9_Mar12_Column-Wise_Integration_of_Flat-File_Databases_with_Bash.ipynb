    "## Compute Observation-Level and Population-Level Frequency Statistics for First Letters of Baby Names for Boys, Girls, and Both Sexes and Save Them to File\n",
    "\n",
    "We are working towards making a processed data-file to compare baby-name first-letter frequencies **pooled over** 14 decades in six different ways: stratified by sex or pooled over sex (3 possibilities), and at the \"observation level\" or \"population-level\" (2 possibilities for a total of $3 \\times 2 = 6$ ways). \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we wish to make a single file flat-file database of first-letter frequencies containing six rows, one for each letter of the alphabet, and seven columns, with letters in teh first column and the other six columns showing **absolute frequencies** (also known as **counts data**) of first-letters over the 14 decades among boys, girls, or both at both population and individual levels of counting. \n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, for this data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the alphabet letters,\n",
    "2. the sex of babies (boy, girl or pooled) and\n",
    "3. the way of counting letters (observation or population levels)\n",
    "\n",
    "are all **explanatory variables** and the frequencies or counts that we have computed for each combination of explanatory variables are **response variables**. Explanatory variables represent controlled or validated inputs to an experimental or observational study and subsequent data science analysis. Explanatory variables help explain response variables, which are like outputs of such studies. In this study on letters, the data has a **frequency response.** In this case, the letters also represent inputs to the associative array we used to compute them as keys whose values are the frequency responses we tallied for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculated and validated our letter frequencies using Bash+Perl one-liners, using separate code for each of the six combinations of explanatory variables (boys/girls/pooled vs individual/population). We saved each calculation to a separate file. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Today we will learn how to use Bash to merge files column-wise, so as to make a flatfile database from separate files of data that have been cleaned and sorted so that all of the rows correspond to the letters in the same order.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generate the Six Frequency Response Files for Different Explanatory Variables \n",
    "\n",
    "Previously we sorted our calculations for baby names first letters by the frequency response to make it easier to read the rank trends in popularity of letters. But in order to make our database master file, we need to make each corresponding row of our six source input files comparable, that is corresponding to the same first letter. The easiest way to do this is to sort alphabetically by the letters instead of by the frequency responses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modify the following code to generate the two intermediate frequency calculations for boys so that they are:**\n",
    "   1. **sorted by letter instead of by frequency response.**\n",
    "   2. **have no leading white space on each line so each line starts with frequencies (Hint: use `tr -s` and `cut -c`), and**\n",
    "   3. **the two fields are separated by the tab character `\\t`. (Hint: the alignment of letters will look a little funny when the output is tab-delimited.)**\n",

This data is more complicated, because there is some missing data. But the alternative more complicated command `join`, which can handle missiong explanatory variables when merging rows, can only merge two input files. So we will make our master-input file in two steps. First we will make two more intermediate files each merging the files with the same number of lines, one for just the two files for boys, and the other for the other four files. We'll inspect the two files and make sure they all are merging corresponding rows for the same letters.\n",
