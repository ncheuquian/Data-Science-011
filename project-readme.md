# Climate Change Impact on Global Temperature Trends

## Project Overview
This presentation analyzes global temperature trends over the past century, focusing on the acceleration of warming in recent decades. The presentation uses simulated data based on NASA's GISS Surface Temperature Analysis dataset patterns to demonstrate data science techniques in R and tidyverse.

## Files Included
- `presentation.qmd`: The main Quarto presentation file
- `README.md`: This file explaining the project

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have the following R packages installed:
   - tidyverse
   - lubridate
   - scales
   - zoo
   - knitr

2. Open the `presentation.qmd` file in RStudio
3. Click the "Render" button to generate the RevealJS presentation
